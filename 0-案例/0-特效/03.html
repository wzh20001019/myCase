				ScrollMagic takes an object oriented approach using a controller for each scroll container
				and attaching multiple scenes defining what should happen at what part of the page. While
				this offers a great deal of control, it might be a little confusing, especially if you're
				just starting out with javascript. If the above points are not crucial for you and you are
				just looking for a simple solution to implement css animations I would strongly recommend
				taking a look at the awesome skrollr project. It almost solely relies on element attributes
				and thus requires minimal to no javascript knowledge.
